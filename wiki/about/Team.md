# Team

We are a welcoming community of [open source enthusiasts and developers](https://github.com/orgs/PureDarwin/people). Everyone is invited to join the PureDarwin project, as long as you agree to promote true open source spirit and abide by any [licenses](Legal) that apply. Unix knowledge is a must at this point.

If you would like to get a puredarwin.org account, please visit #puredarwin on irc.freenode.net. Also, send an e-mail, including your full name, contact information and your desired PureDarwin username (ideally the same as your IRC nickname) to admin@puredarwin.org. 

If you like, you can also include information about your hardware so that we can coordinate testing better.
