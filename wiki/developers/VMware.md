VMware
======

![This article is outdated and its information and may no longer relevant.](/img/notice/article-oudated-oct2024.svg)


Many [VMware](http://www.vmware.com/) products are now able to run a Darwin system (e.g., PureDarwin).
From *VMware Fusion 2.0* (Mac OS X) to *VMware Player 2.5* (free download for Windows and Linux) via *VMware ESX* and later versions, PureDarwin should boot without any troubles.

**A more precise list will be constituted if respective [feedback](../todo.html) is received.**

Running PureDarwin in VMware
----------------------------
It is very easy to run PureDarwin with VMware.
### Requirements
a VMware product
a PureDarwin system (can be downloaded or produced)
-   a ready-to-run .vmwarevm (read-write) or .vmdk
-   a PureDarwin ISO, and either use it directly (read-only)
    This ISO can be converted into a VMware disk image (.vmdk) file using a little conversion tool called `qemu-img'.
    The resulting disk image will be read-write, and can be mounted by double-clicking so that you can change its contents from the host system:
    `qemu-img convert -O vmdk PureDarwin.iso PureDarwin.vmdk`

Launch VMware Fusion 2.0 or later and create a new machine based on the ISO or .vmdk - VMware Fusion will automatically recognize it as "Mac OS X Server" and configure the virtual machine accordingly. You do not need to change any settings. 
### Using VMware other than Fusion 
Two KEXTs appeard useful for VMware release(s) other than Fusion:

-   LegacyAppleIntelPIIXATA
-   NullCPUPowerManagement
They can be found in VMware-Drivers-OpenSource.zip. See [Downloads](../downloads.html) page.

Settings
--------
### VMware settings
#### Enable the built-in VNC server
Add these lines in the .vmx file:

`RemoteDisplay.vnc.port = "5900"
RemoteDisplay.vnc.enabled = "TRUE"
# optional password:
RemoteDisplay.vnc.password = "password"
`

Then simply connect your favorite VNC client to localhost.
### Boot arguments
(please add text)
### Faking guest OS detection
We need to fake VMware guest OS detection in order to avoid error message "*The guest operating system is not Mac OS X Server*" (implicitly to simply boot).

![](/img/developers/vmware/VMware%20guest%20os%20detection.png)

VMware guest OS detection is trivial, and so the way to avoid it:

 `touch "/Volumes/PureDarwin/System/Library/CoreServices/ServerVersion.plist"``
`
__Note:__ This tweak should/could be deprecated by time.

Boot
----
### VMware Fusion BIOS
VMware Fusion comes with a combo PhoenixBIOS/VMware BIOS.

![](/img/developers/vmware/VMware%20fusion%20bios%202.png)
### Bootloader
VMware uses darwin.iso (VMware Tools) which contains the DFE bootloader (Stage 2 boot file < 128K) to provide a bootloader.
#### darwin.iso

Located in /Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/isoimages/original/darwin.iso
ISO 9660 CD-ROM filesystem data 'CD' (bootable)


pdisk reports:
Partition map (with 512 byte blocks) on 'original/darwin.iso'
 #:                type name                  length   base   ( size )
 1: Apple_partition_map Apple                     63 @ 1     
 2:           Apple_HFS DiscRecording 3.2.0f2   6940 @ 244    (  3.4M)


Device block size=2048, Number of Blocks=3339059200 (6.2T)
DeviceType=0x0, DeviceId=0x0


The DFE bootloader:
-r--r--r--@ 1 201  wheel  63520 Jun 23 00:20 /Volumes/VMware Tools/.hiddendir/boot (dfeâ€™)
In order to compare the siwe, Chameleon takes 295328B and the latest DFE 63648B.


Facing the bootloader size limitation:
![](/img/developers/vmware/VMware%20booter%20size%20limitation.png)


It is possible to alter the content of darwin.iso, but the package needs to be signed again.


hdiutil -readwrite attach darwin.iso
hdiutil eject..
openssl genrsa -out tools-priv.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in tools-priv.pem -pubout -out tools-key.pub
openssl dgst -sha1 -sign tools-priv.pem < darwin.iso > darwin.iso.sig
for A in *.iso ; do openssl dgst -sha1 -sign tools-priv.pem < $A > $A.sig ; done

### Single user mode
It boots.

![](../_/rsrc/1218489175310/developers/vmware/VMware%20single%20user-mode.png%3Fheight=150&width=200)
### Multi user mode
It boots but fails because of read-only medium when a connected CD/DVD drive is configured to use a disk image (ISO).
It works when a VMware disk image (.vmdk) is used since read-write is enabled (and functional) by default.
Network
-------
### Emulated NICs
**VMware seems to provide 3 emulated NIC:**
-   **e1000**
-   **VMware NIC - vmxnet
    **High performance (Gigabit), need VMware drivers in the guest.
    OK for production.
-   **VLANCE (aka AMD PCNET-32)
    **Lower perf, high CPU load, no kext available, problems solved. Update November 2012: A driver is in the works at <https://code.google.com/p/pcnet32-driver-for-puredarwin/> - **information about this driver still needs to be worked into this page**
#### e1000
VMware emulates an Intel e1000 network card.
"e1000" is apparently a generic term for a **series** of similar but different chips.

### Status

The VMware virtual device chipset seems to correspond to the Intel82545EM (Copper)

-   **Vendor ID:** 0x8086
-   **Primary device ID:** 0x100F


Mac OS X contains a driver (AppleIntel8254XEthernet) for the chip emulated by VMware which "should match and work".
**But** this driver is __not available__ for Darwin yet, neither in source nor binary form.

We found also two KEXTs close (but not enough "by nature") to the VMware 82545EM virtual device:
-   AppleIntel8255x (built from the [Darwinbuild](darwinbuild.html) project)
-   [82566mm-osx-driver](http://code.google.com/p/82566mm-osx-driver/) (an OpenSource one)
Both of the two KEXTs personality file (Info.plist) can be modified to match the VMware virtual device in order to be (kext)loaded at boot.
**But no interface (e.g., en0) is affected...**


The 
e1000 support quest
-------------------
### Notions
#### Driver and IOPCIDevice
PCI stands for Peripheral Component Interconnect.

A driver for a PCI Ethernet controller inherits from IOEthernetController but uses an instance of IOPCIDevice class (in order to connect to the PCI bus).
IOPCIDevice is a basic nub class representing any PCI device in any PCI slot.

Ethernet driver <-> IOPCIDevice <-> IOPCIBridge <-> IOPlatformDevice <-> ...
#### PCI matching summarization
A driver can control a device on a PCI bus.
A driver announces this fact by including a "*personality*" in its plist file.
This personality includes IOProviderClass=IOPCIDevice (Key=Value).
IOPCIDevice defines 2 sets of keys that a driver can use for matching:
-   a key based on standard PCI registers
-   a key based on Open Firmware (probably related to PPC only)
A PCI device driver can use one type of key or both of them (if personalities are disjoint)
### Vendor and Device IDs
#### Vendor ID (intel def.)
This uniquely identifies all Intel PCI products.
This field may be auto-loaded from the EEPROM at power on or upon the assertion of PCI_RST#.
A value of 0x8086 is the default for this field upon power up if the EEPROM does not respond or is not programmed. 
****
#### Device ID (Intel def.)
This uniquely identifies the Ethernet controller.
This field may be autoloaded from the EEPROM at power on or upon the assertion of RST#.
The default value for this field is used upon power up if the EEPROM does not respond or is not programmed.

#### PCI configuration space registers 

-   vendor and device ID (offsets 0x00 and 0x002)
-   subsystem vendor and device ID (offsets 0x2C and 0x2E)
-   class code (offset 0x09)
-   revision ID (not available in property matching)
-   header type (not available in property matching)
#### PCI matching dictionary
Value for a key can be a single register value or a list (space separator).
Register values are little-endian hexa strings (device ID first then vendor ID).
A mask can be included (only a part of the value is compared), bits set to 0 are ignored by the mask 
-   IOPCIMatch
    matches against primary vendor/device ID registers (checked first)
    or
    matches aganst the subsystem vendor/device ID
-   IOPCIPrimaryMatch
    matches against primary vendor/device ID registers
-   IOPCISecondaryMatch
    matches against the subsystem vendor/device ID registers
-   IOPCIClassMatch
    matches against the class code register
Examples of corresponding key/value based on vendor and device id which can be expected in *Info.plist*:

Vendor ID: 0x8086
Primary device ID: 0x100F
`<key>IOPCIMatch</key>`
``


Vendor ID: 0x8086
Primary device ID: 0x1000 or 0x100F

`<key>IOPCIMatch</key>`
`0x10008086 0x100F8086`



Vendor ID: 0x8086
Primary device ID: 0x1000..0x10FF (first two digits subsystem IDs are not checked)

`<key>IOPCIPrimaryMatch</key>`
<span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;font-size:small"><string>0x10008086&0xFF00FFFF</string></span>

Class code for ethernet controller (0x0200 (in fact 4bytes, last byte ignored))
`<key>IOPCIClassMatch</key>`
<span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;font-size:small"><string>0x02000000&0xffff0000</string></span>



Which is confirmed on
-   **FreeBSD:** **
-   **GNU/Linux:** 
-   **Intel:** From the "*Intel PCI/PCI-X Family of Gigabit Ethernet Controllers Software Developerâ€™s Manual*", 
    A list of pair model / device id is available in the Intel spec, which confirm the result above ( "IOModel" = "82545EM Copper" )
-   **e1000 from sourceforge:** *82540EP/EM, 82541xx, 82544GC/EI, 82545GM/EM, 82546GB/EB, and 82547xx*

#### AppleIntel8255x

#### Intel82566MM

Intel82566MM.kext can be build and loaded.

Info.plist needs to be modified to match VMware device.

No interface is shown..




Jul 12 19:17:19 PureDarwin kernel[0]: venderid: 0x8086 deviceid: 0x100f.



It seems really clear that this kext has been derivated from the FreeBSD branch too (even comments are almost identic).

Editing the plist is naturally not enough, so after adding a couple of defines and enable debug on stdout, it looks like:


Jul 15 00:38:44 PureDarwin kernel[0]: Intel82566MM debug: bool Intel82566MM::Init(OSDictionary *properties).

Jul 15 00:38:44 PureDarwin kernel[0]: Intel82566MM debug: Intel82566MM::start(IOService * provider)

Jul 15 00:38:45 PureDarwin kernel[0]: Intel82566MM debug: void Intel82566MM::free()

The red part can be found in *Intel82566M.cpp* and corresponds to:

 
 if (flashPCIAddress == NULL) {
 e_debug("flashPCIAddress.n");
 goto FAILED_OPENED;
 }


Which irremediably leads to

FAILED_OPENED:
 pciDevice->close(this);
At "free()", it's already too late anyway..

After altering a bit the code, we can go further.. but not so far.

![](/img/developers/vmware/8266MM%20debug%20I.png)

In the FreeBSD src code:


/**

 *  e1000_read_mac_addr_82540 - Read device MAC address

 *  @hw: pointer to the HW structure

 *

 *  Reads the device MAC address from the EEPROM and stores the value.

 *  Since devices with two ports use the same EEPROM, we increment the

 *  last bit in the MAC address for the second port.

 *

 *  This version is being used over generic because of customer issues

 *  with VmWare and Virtual Box when using generic. It seems in

 *  the emulated 82545, RAR[0] does NOT have a valid address after a

 *  reset, this older method works and using this breaks nothing for

 *  these legacy adapters.

### a KEXT pseudo-life
The driver inspects and configure the PCI Device
1.  driver examines the values in the PCI configuration space registers (e.g., revision ID register)
2.  driver sets some value of them (e.g., enable memory write)
3.  driver interacts with its device

(random notes: ipconfig set en0 NONE before kextunload &lt;- not tested)




Pseudo-pre-deduction: If the kext is loaded but no interface, could it be?:

`start`{style="font-size:11px;font-family:Monaco,Courier,Consolas,monospace"}
:   The `start`{style="font-size:11px;font-family:Monaco,Courier,Consolas,monospace"} function should initialize the device to a working state. It also needs to create a network object and make it visible to the networking stack as an interface
    
    
network driver's start function:
-   set network interface object
-   a work loop
-   an output queue
-   specific resources
-   (also retains its provider nub (IOPCIDevice?))

In order to open the Provider nub, the driver should:
1.  verify that it is of the appropriate class
2.  retain a reference to it
3.  open it in order to access its services

### Host NIC

Restarts all the vmnet services on the **host side**:

`/Library/Application Support/VMware Fusion/boot.sh --restart`
Troubleshooting

### On read-only medium
The tty is flooded with log telling attempt to write on a read-only medium (ie: auth mechanism too) does not work.
**** Another obvious implicit goal is to install PureDarwin with PureDarwin.
