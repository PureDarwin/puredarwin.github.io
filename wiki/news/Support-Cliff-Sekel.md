### Meet Cliff

Meet Cliff Sekel aka InSaneDarwin on most platforms, a Senior Cybersecurity Architect with a deep passion for open-source software, security, and innovation. By day, Cliff works full-time in the cybersecurity industry, ensuring systems remain safe and resilient. By night (and often in the precious moments in between), he dedicates himself to PureDarwin, an open-source OS project that brings the power of Apple’s Darwin to the broader community.

But beyond his professional and open-source contributions, Cliff is also a devoted husband and a loving father of three young children. Every moment outside of work and coding is spent with his beautiful wife Kaitlynn and their little ones (Alex, Nick and Mateo) cherishing the time they have together.

Tragically, Cliff is also facing one of the toughest battles of his life—Stage 4 Colon Cancer. Despite this, he remains committed to his health, his family, his work, and his contributions to the open-source world. However, as treatments become more intensive and time becomes more precious, he needs support.

### Why Support Cliff?

Every contribution helps alleviate the burden of medical expenses and gives him more time to focus on what he loves: spending time with his family and advancing the PureDarwin project. His work has already pushed the boundaries of what’s possible in the open-source community, and with your help, he can continue making a lasting impact.

Your donation isn’t just about supporting one person—it’s about helping an entire community thrive. PureDarwin is a labor of love, and every dollar gives Cliff the freedom to continue building, innovating, and leaving behind a legacy that will inspire future generations of developers and open-source enthusiasts.

### How You Can Help
